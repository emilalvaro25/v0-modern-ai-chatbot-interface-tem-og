[TASK END]
Task: Remove Thinking Mode Tags from Chat View
End Time: 2025-01-17 00:41
Summary: Removed the tags display section (lines 225-237) that showed "Thinking Mode", "Deep Reasoning", "Chain-of-Thought", and "Analytical" badges at the top of conversations. The chat interface is now cleaner and shows only the conversation title and message count.
Issues: None
